## Environment
### Qt 5.14.2
### Qt Creator 4.11.1

## Description
### This is my first Coding Project in my career(When I was a Freshman), it took me about 3 weeks to perfect this project and design all kinds of ui(buttons, background...). Also, I learned about Computer Network at the same time then designed an Online-Mode for this game using TCP-Protocol, and it turned out that this game works well in LAN.
### Together there are over 4000 lines of C code in this project, and NONE of them are prewritten by others(like some kind of framework in some course projects), which I am pretty proud of.

## Release
### If you want to try this project, I have already uploaded a release version, download and extract it then you can run the game
